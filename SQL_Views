CREATE VIEW vw_EmployeeBasicInfo AS
SELECT

    e.FirstName,
    e.LastName,
    d.DepartmentName
FROM
    Employees AS e
JOIN
    Departments AS d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
GO

-- Query the view to see the result
SELECT * FROM vw_EmployeeBasicInfo;

Exercise 2: Add Computed Column - Full Name 
CREATE VIEW vw_EmployeeFullName AS
SELECT
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS FullName, -- Computed column
    d.DepartmentName
FROM
    Employees AS e
JOIN
    Departments AS d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
GO

-- Query the view to see the result
SELECT * FROM vw_EmployeeFullName;

Exercise 3: Add Computed Column - Annual Salary 
CREATE VIEW vw_EmployeeAnnualSalary AS
SELECT
    EmployeeID,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    Salary,
    Salary * 12 AS AnnualSalary -- Computed column
FROM
    Employees;
GO

-- Query the view to see the result
SELECT * FROM vw_EmployeeAnnualSalary;

Exercise 4: Add Multiple Computed Columns 
CREATE VIEW vw_EmployeeReport AS
SELECT
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName + ' ' + e.LastName AS FullName,      -- Computed column 1
    d.DepartmentName,
    e.Salary * 12 AS AnnualSalary,                   -- Computed column 2
    (e.Salary * 12) * 0.10 AS Bonus                  -- Computed column 3
FROM
    Employees AS e
JOIN
    Departments AS d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
GO
