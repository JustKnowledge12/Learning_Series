-- Step 1: Query to fetch product details before index creation
-- On a large table, this would perform a full table scan.
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductName = 'Laptop';

-- Step 2: Create a non-clustered index on ProductName
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Products_ProductName ON Products(ProductName);

-- Step 3: Query to fetch product details after index creation
-- On a large table, this will now use the index for a fast lookup (an Index Seek).
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductName = 'Laptop';

Exercise 2: Creating a Clustered Index
-- Goal: Create a clustered index on the OrderDate column in the Orders table and compare query execution time before and after index creation.
 Step 1: Query to fetch orders before index creation
-- This query would scan the table, which is ordered by OrderID, not OrderDate.
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate = '2023-01-15';

-- Step 2: Create a clustered index on OrderDate
-- First, find and drop the existing Primary Key constraint
ALTER TABLE Orders DROP CONSTRAINT PK__Orders__C3905BAF
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Orders_OrderDate ON Orders(OrderDate);
ALTER TABLE Orders ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Orders_OrderID PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED (OrderID);

-- Exercise 3: Creating a Composite Index
-- Goal: Create a composite index on the CustomerID and OrderDate columns in the Orders table and compare query execution time before and after index creation.

- Step 1: Query to fetch orders before index creation
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID = 1 AND OrderDate = '2023-01-15';
- Step 2: Create a composite index on CustomerID and OrderDate
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Orders_CustomerID_OrderDate ON Orders(CustomerID, OrderDate);
-- Step 3: Query to fetch orders after index creation
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID = 1 AND OrderDate = '2023-01-15';
